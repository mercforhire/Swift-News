 A class that help us fetch some data from the internet and converts the data to defined Model objects is considered a 'service'.
 
 This ServiceFactory is the common place where all these services are stored. We expect a production app to have numerous different API services. This class also does all the tedious initialization work for every service IE: setting up any dependencies.
